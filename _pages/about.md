I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Clemson University, working under the supervision of Dr. Nianyi Li in the Advanced Imaging Lab. My research primarily focuses on the low-level vision tasks, with a particular emphasis on the restoration of images and videos. My research is geared towards developing cutting-edge algorithms for video denoising and deblurring. My [CV] can ne accessed here (https://maryaiyetigbo.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
